# New-script-generator

I get tired of making new scripts and adding the "#! /...." line at the top all the time, so I made this script. 

Originally, I just made one for sh files and another one for py files (each were bash scripts), but I got bored and decided to try making one for both using Python. Plus, I thought it would be a good way to practice creating / reading / writing / etc files with Python. 

So this script starts off asking you which script you want to make, after which, it will ask you to give the file a name. 

The script will then create the file, add the appropriate first line with two additional blank lines, and then open it with nano and set the cursor at the end of the file, ready for you to start typing.
